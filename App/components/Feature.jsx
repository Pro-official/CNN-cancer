            Cancer is a disease in which some of the bodyâ€™s cells grow

            can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of
            trillions of cells. Normally, human cells grow and multiply (through
            a process called cell division) to form new cells as the body needs

            take their place... &nbsp;
